# Dependency Management and Containerization

**I'll update this doc once I'm at home.**

Hi, I'll try to explain here about what I did (and the rationale behind those decisions), and how I did them. You'll still have to read additional resources.

## Dependency Management

For dependency management I've chosen `pdm` over `poetry` and `pipenv`. It is faster than both of the contenders.

## Containerization

For this I've used `docker` along with `docker-compose`.
