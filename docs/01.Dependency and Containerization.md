# Dependency Management and Containerization

**I'll update this doc once I'm at home. For now, all the mysterious things are happening in the `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml`.**

Hi, I'll try to explain here about what I did (and the rationale behind those decisions), and how I did them. You'll still have to read additional resources.

## Dependency Management

For dependency management I've chosen `pdm` over `poetry` and `pipenv`. It is faster than both of the contenders.

## Containerization

For this I've used `docker` along with `docker-compose`.

In a nutshell, docker compose allow you to manage containers in an orchestrated manner. Like we can create PostgreSQL service, and our server service and link them in an internal network.

### A note on the choice of base image.

1. I haven't chosen `alpine` images. Yes, the are small, but they are slower also.
2. Not debian also. They are too much restricting. Image processing libraries can give real pain in those images.
3. Ubuntu images are balanced, so I've chosen an Ubuntu image with custom scripts for package installations and upgrades so that we can get leaner images.
